=== DNA MUTATION PATHOGENICITY ANALYSIS CONCLUSIONS (ADVANCED) ===

Date: 2026-02-11 23:35:44

PROJECT GOAL:
Build a classification model to determine whether a given mutation
in DNA sequence is pathogenic (disease-causing).

============================================================

DATA SUMMARY:
   • Number of samples: 100
   • Number of genes: 4
   • Pathogenic mutations: 41
   • Benign mutations: 59
   • Generated ML features: 84

MACHINE LEARNING MODEL RESULTS:
   • Best model: SVM
   • Accuracy: 40.0%
   • F1-score: 57.1%
   • ROC AUC: 44.8%

MUTATION HOTSPOTS:
   • Identified hotspots: 16
   • Hotspots are positions with high frequency of pathogenic mutations
   • May indicate critical functional regions in genes

KEY CONCLUSIONS:

1. MEDIUM CLASSIFICATION QUALITY
   Model requires further tuning, but shows potential.
   More data or better features needed.

2. MOST FREQUENTLY MUTATED GENE: BRCA1
   Gene BRCA1 accounts for 29 mutations.
   Requires special attention in clinical research.

3. KEY PREDICTIVE FEATURES:
   • K-mers (3-nucleotide patterns): local sequence structure
   • GC content: DNA structure stability
   • Mutation position: functional context
   • Hotspot proximity: pathogenicity risk

4. PRACTICAL APPLICATION:
   Model can serve as:
   • Support tool for clinical geneticists
   • Prioritization system for mutations requiring further research
   • Component of larger genomic analysis pipeline

============================================================
NOTE: Results require validation on independent datasets
before application in clinical practice.
